# TLDW (Too Long; Didn't Watch)

TLDW turns long-form YouTube videos into a structured learning workspace. Paste a URL and the app generates highlight reels, timestamped AI answers, and a place to capture your own notes so you can absorb an hour-long video in minutes.

## Overview

The project is a Next.js 15 + React 19 application that wraps Google Gemini 2.5 models and Supadata transcripts with a polished UX. Supabase provides authentication, persistence, rate limiting, and profile preferences. The experience is optimized for fast iteration using Turbopack, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui components.

## Feature Highlights

- AI highlight reels with Smart (quality) and Fast (speed) generation modes, Play All playback, and theme-based re-generation.
- Gemini-powered quick preview, structured summary, suggested questions, and memorable quotes surfaced in parallel.
- AI chat grounded in the transcript with structured JSON responses, timestamp citations, and fallbacks when Gemini rate-limits.
- Transcript viewer that stays in sync with the YouTube player; click any sentence to jump or capture the quote.
- Personal notes workspace with transcript, chat, and takeaway sources plus an `/all-notes` dashboard for cross-video review.
- Authenticated library pages for saved analyses, favorites, generation limits, and Supabase-backed profile preferences.
- Aggressive caching of previous analyses, background refresh tasks, and rate limits for anonymous vs. signed-in users.
- Security middleware that enforces CSP headers, CSRF protection, body-size caps, and Supabase-backed rate limiting.

## Architecture

- Frontend stack: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, lucide-react, sonner toasts.
- Backend runtime: Next.js serverless route handlers with `withSecurity` middleware for CSRF, input validation (Zod), and rate caps.
- AI pipeline: `lib/ai-processing.ts` and `lib/gemini-client.ts` orchestrate Gemini 2.5 models with structured output schemas, cascading fallbacks, and transcript chunking.
- Transcript & metadata: Supadata API delivers transcripts; lightweight YouTube oEmbed calls pull thumbnails and titles.
- Persistence: Supabase stores `video_analyses`, `user_videos` (history + favorites), `user_notes`, `profiles` (topic generation mode, profile data), and `rate_limits`.
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with session refresh in `middleware.ts`; `AuthModal` drives sign-up prompts when limits are hit.
- Security: Global middleware adds CSP/HSTS headers, CSRF tokens for stateful requests, hashed IP identifiers for anonymous rate limiting, and request body size guards.

## Application Pages

- `/` – Landing page with branded URL input, mode selector, and auth modal triggers when rate limits are reached.
- `/analyze/[videoId]` – Primary workspace: YouTube player, highlight reels, theme selector, summary/chat/transcript/notes tabs, suggestions, and note-saving flows.
- `/my-videos` – Auth-required library of previously analyzed videos with search, favorites, and quick resume.
- `/all-notes` – Auth-required notebook that aggregates notes across videos with filtering, sorting, markdown rendering, and deletion.
- `/settings` – Profile screen for updating name, password, viewing usage stats, and persisting preferred topic generation mode.

## API Surface

- Video ingestion: `/api/video-info`, `/api/transcript`, `/api/check-video-cache`, `/api/video-analysis`, `/api/save-analysis`, `/api/update-video-analysis`, `/api/link-video`.
- AI generation: `/api/generate-topics`, `/api/generate-summary`, `/api/quick-preview`, `/api/suggested-questions`, `/api/top-quotes`.
- Conversational tools: `/api/chat` (Gemini chat with citations) and `/api/check-limit` for pre-flight rate checks.
- User data: `/api/notes`, `/api/notes/all`, `/api/toggle-favorite`.
- Security utilities: `/api/csrf-token` and the shared `withSecurity` middleware (allowed methods, rate limits, CSRF validation).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (Next.js 15 requires 18.18 or newer)
- `npm` (repo uses package-lock.json), though `pnpm` or `yarn` also work
- Supabase project (Auth + Postgres) and API keys for Supadata & Google Gemini

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tldw.git
cd tldw
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env.local` in the repo root:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | yes | Google Gemini API key (2.5 models) |
| `SUPADATA_API_KEY` | yes | Supadata transcript API key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | yes | Supabase anonymous key |
| `CSRF_SALT` | yes | Long random string used to sign CSRF tokens |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | optional | Canonical app URL (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | optional | Enables additional metadata when available |
| `UNLIMITED_VIDEO_USERS` | optional | Comma-separated emails or user IDs allowed to bypass daily limits |

> Generate a unique `CSRF_SALT` (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32`). `UNLIMITED_VIDEO_USERS` entries are normalized to lowercase.

### 3. Supabase Setup

1. Run SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` using the Supabase SQL editor or CLI.
2. Ensure the following tables exist (structure documented in `CLAUDE.md`): `video_analyses`, `user_videos`, `user_notes`, `profiles`, and `rate_limits`.
3. Add the Postgres function `upsert_video_analysis_with_user_link` that stores analyses and links them to a user in `user_videos` (the production project contains the reference implementation—export it or recreate it before local testing).
4. Enable email OTP/auth providers required by your login flow and configure redirect URLs to match `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev        # starts Next.js with Turbopack on http://localhost:3000
npm run lint       # optional: run lint checks (ESLint v9)
```

The dev server reaches out to Gemini and Supadata directly, so make sure those API keys have local allowlists if your project settings restrict origins.

## Developer Notes

- All state-changing requests must go through `csrfFetch` so that `withSecurity` can validate the token.
- Rate limiting records are stored in the `rate_limits` table; clear it when resetting dev limits.
- Topic generation mode (`smart` vs `fast`) is persisted per-profile and synced via `useModePreference`.
- `middleware.ts` refreshes Supabase sessions and adds security headers—keep it enabled when deploying to Vercel.
- Detailed architecture notes, prompts, and database expectations live in `CLAUDE.md`; review it before larger changes.
